        <h1>About the author and the project.</h1>
        <h2>My name is Pawel and I built this application to practice web development (especially front-end) skills.</h2>
        <section>
            <h3>Map of the application:</h3>
            <p>This application was built to give user access to recipes database, allow them to manage their favorites, and create and store their own ones.</p>

            <p>Default functionality (<em>for not logged in users</em>) allows to view all recipes, display them by categories, and go to each recipe page to check the details. Without logging in there's no more that user can do.</p>

            <p>After login, the user receives more functionality. As a signed user you can now add selected recipes to your favorites, and create or edit your own recipes. You can also directly access your favorites/personal recipes and display them all. To check the functionality just <b>login with default credentials</b> provided in 'login' section.</p>

            <p>There is also possibility to create your own basic account, and manage recipes from there.</p>
