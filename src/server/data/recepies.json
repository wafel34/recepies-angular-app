            "Lower the eggs into a pan of vigorously simmering water and boil for 5½ minutes exactly, then refresh under cold water until cool enough to handle, and peel. Meanwhile, put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat. In a bowl, mix the flour with a little pinch of sea salt, 4 tablespoons of yoghurt and 1 tablespoon of olive oil until you have a dough. Halve, then roll out each piece on a flour-dusted surface until just under ½cm thick. Cook for 3 minutes, or until golden, turning halfway. Dot the mango chutney and remaining yoghurt over the breads. Halve the soft- boiled eggs and arrange on top, smashing them in with a fork, if you like. Finely slice the chilli and scatter over (as much as you dare!), drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and season with salt and black pepper from a height."
