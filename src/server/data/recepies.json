Meanwhile, put a large non-stick frying pan on a medium-high heat. In a bowl, mix the flour with a little pinch of sea salt, 4 tablespoons of yoghurt and 1 tablespoon of olive oil until you have a dough. Halve, then roll out each piece on a flour-dusted surface until just under ½cm thick. Cook for 3 minutes, or until golden, turning halfway. Dot the mango chutney and remaining yoghurt over the breads. Halve the soft- boiled eggs and arrange on top, smashing them in with a fork, if you like. Finely slice the chilli and scatter over (as much as you dare!), drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil and season with salt and black pepper from a height.",

Add a few ladles of batter to the pan, leaving space between each one so they have room to spread out slightly – each ladleful will make one pancake, and you’ll need to work in batches.\n5. Cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until little bubbles appear on the surface and the bases are golden, then carefully flip them over.\n6. When the pancakes are golden on both sides, remove to a plate. \n7. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding a little more oil to the pan between batches, if needed. \n8. Serve the pancakes while they’re still hot, with a dollop of yoghurt and some extra fresh berries, if you like.",

Separately, toast the hazelnuts and coconut in a dry frying pan until lightly golden, then bash up in a pestle and mortar. \n4. Peel the bananas and tear into the blender, then blitz with the hazelnut milk, vanilla extract and two-thirds of the black rice – depending on the sweetness of your bananas, you could also add a teaspoon of honey.\n5. Once smooth, stir that back through the rest of the rice – this will give you great texture and colour. Divide between four nice jars or bowls.\n6. Spoon over the blitzed mango, squeeze half a passion fruit over each one, then delicately spoon over the yoghurt and sprinkle with the hazelnuts and coconut.",
